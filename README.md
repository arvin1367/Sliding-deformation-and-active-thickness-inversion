“There are still issues with the thickness inversion code currently uploaded, and a successful code will be uploaded in the future.”
Extracting Time Series in the Sliding Direction and Active Thickness for Creep Landslides Using Multi-Period Spaceborne InSAR-Derived Data!
These codes are used for extracting the deformation time series of landslide in the sliding direction and inverting the activity thickness. Please refer to the script (main.m) for specific usage.
